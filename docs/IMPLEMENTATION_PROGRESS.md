# HospAI Implementation Progress

Last updated: 2026-03-04

## Purpose

This document tracks implemented work completed in the repository during the current execution stream, the major remaining scope gaps, and the next recommended delivery slices.

## Implemented So Far

### Dashboard

- Added operational hospital summary widgets to the main dashboard.
- Surfaced OP/IP counts, revenue, due amount, accident counts, payment mix, referral sources, diagnostics income, and pharmacy sales.

### Patient Module

- Patient registration remains in place.
- Added registration desk scheduling and token queue support.
- Added a dedicated OP desk workflow with:
  - doctor schedule setup
  - OP day summary
  - appointment queue filtering
  - follow-up scheduling
- Added OP appointment operations for:
  - reminder sent tracking
  - no-show marking
- Added registration-side operations for:
  - digital consent capture
  - structured insurance verification logging
- Added clinical operations in patient detail:
  - encounters
  - bed assignments
  - medication schedules
  - observation notes
- Added patient visit timeline.
- Added patient transaction history (billing and diagnostics when permissions allow).
- Added patient-linked certificate workflows:
  - discharge summary
  - medical certificate
  - insurance document
  - fit-to-work

### Billing

- Added support for invoice advances and refunds.
- Expanded revenue summary with:
  - total advance
  - total refunded
  - collections by module
- Updated billing UI to capture and show these values.
- Added insurance claim tracking linked to invoices:
  - claim amount
  - approved amount
  - claim status
  - external claim reference
- Added billing analytics depth for:
  - receivable aging buckets
  - payment reconciliation summary
  - converted payment tracking
- Exposed payment conversion fields in the billing payment workflow so reconciliation metrics are driven from user-entered payment conversions.

### Pharmacy

- Added pharmacy sales listing API.
- Added pharmacy sales reporting in the frontend.
- Added pharmacy workflow depth for:
  - prescription-linked dispensing
  - supplier master records
  - procurement / purchase orders

### Lab / Diagnostics

- Expanded lab diagnostics reporting in the frontend with:
  - vendor visibility
  - invoice number visibility
  - doctor-wise income
  - invoice-wise diagnostics breakdown
- Added diagnostic order lifecycle fields:
  - sample barcode
  - order status
  - sample collected timestamp
  - report issued timestamp

### Reports

- Added a dedicated `reports` module with explicit module-level access.
- Added backend reports overview endpoint.
- Added frontend Reports page with cross-module operational and financial summaries.
- Expanded reports with:
  - clinic-wise income
  - discount by module
  - payment status breakdown
  - ALOS summary
- Added report exports:
  - CSV
  - PDF
  - Word

### OT / Operation Theatre

- Added a dedicated `ot` module with explicit module-level access.
- Added backend OT domain support for:
  - theatre master records
  - surgery schedules
  - OT utilization summary
- Added frontend OT operations page for:
  - theatre setup
  - surgery scheduling
  - theatre status tracking
  - surgery status updates
- Expanded OT analytics with:
  - scheduled/completed hours
  - theatre-wise utilisation

### Accounts

- Added a dedicated `accounts` module with explicit module-level access.
- Added backend accounts foundations for:
  - general ledger entries
  - vendor payments
  - doctor payouts
  - accounts summary totals
- Added frontend Accounts page for ledger, vendor, and doctor payout operations.

### Admin / Settings

- Replaced the placeholder settings page with a usable audit log viewer.
- Fixed audit field mapping to match backend schema.

### Responsive UI

- Updated the shared frontend layout for improved mobile compatibility.
- Sidebar now reflows into a sticky top rail on tablet and mobile widths.
- Navigation is horizontally scrollable on smaller screens.
- Module headers, inline actions, forms, and buttons now collapse more cleanly for phone-sized layouts.
- Reduced accidental horizontal overflow in the shared shell.

## Validation Completed

- Repeated frontend production builds with `npm run build` succeeded after each major slice.
- Repeated focused backend validation with:
  - `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests/test_hms_modules.py -q`
  passed after each backend slice.
- Added additional documentation and regression coverage for the expanded modules:
  - [docs/IMPLEMENTATION_HANDOFF.md](/Users/subigyalamichhane/kalpra/Keppler_healthcare/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_HANDOFF.md)
  - new backend regression tests for reports, OT, accounts, OP, and pharmacy procurement
  - new frontend unit tests for Reports, OP, OT, and Accounts
  - new e2e coverage for advanced operations workspaces
- Added follow-on regression coverage for:
  - registration consents and insurance verification
  - diagnostics lifecycle fields and status transitions
  - pharmacy supplier and procurement UI/API flows
- Added browser-driven workspace smoke coverage for:
  - Add Patient registration desk panels
  - Pharmacy workflow panels
  - Lab workflow panels
- Added browser-driven workspace smoke coverage for:
  - Billing workflow panels
  - OT workflow panels
  - Accounts workflow panels

## Remaining Major Gaps Against Original Scope

The original modules documentation is still not fully satisfied. Major remaining gaps:

- fuller OP module:
  - richer calendar views
  - deeper calendar / reminder automation
- registration depth:
  - deeper OCR / ID extraction
- billing depth:
  - fuller claim settlement lifecycle
- diagnostics depth:
  - richer workflow automation / alerts
- pharmacy depth:
  - deeper stock automation / reorder workflows
- responsive polish:
  - page-specific refinement for the most crowded module screens on smaller devices

## Current Delivery Strategy

Work is being completed in coherent, testable slices instead of a single high-risk rewrite. Each slice is expected to:

- reuse existing backend primitives when possible
- preserve permission enforcement
- remain backward-compatible with the current database
- include validation before moving on
- update the implementation documentation when the delivered scope changes materially

## Next Recommended Slices

1. Apply page-specific mobile refinements to dense workflows like Billing, Patients, and Add Patient.
2. Deepen OP with richer calendar views and reminder automation.
3. Expand insurer settlement and financial reconciliation depth.
